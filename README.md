# Connectė
Connectė is an implementation of the game Connect4 using React and Python flask. In the game you can play against other opponents or a bot that utilizes the alpha-beta pruning algorithm to select the moves that lead to the best outcome. The website also implements multiple game modes that would be impossible to play on a physical board.
